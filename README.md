# To Do React App
## [You can check it here](https://iuliancrudu.github.io/ToDoReactApp/)
This is my first React App, made it so that i can practice the things that i've learned in some courses.

#Installing
1. Download the project
2. In the project folder type " npm install"
3. run "npm start"

Plan on adding more functionality like:
1. Getting the list from a database and storing it there
2. Some routing for more list collections and/or history of items added
3. Drag and Drop
4. Animation for adding/completing and deleting items
